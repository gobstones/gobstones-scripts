/**
 *
 * This is the programmatic API, it allows to perform all the
 * same set of actions from the CLI, but from a module.
 *
 * It also exports the configuration files and the version, as attributes.
 *
 * Finally, it adds the `tools` attribute that exposes some additional
 * tooling that may be used on your `package-scripts.js` if you decide to
 * override it.
 *
 * Refer to README.md for more information.
